# Archive Cache Manager
![Achive Cache Manager logo](images/logo-v2-title.png?raw=true "Achive Cache Manager")

A LaunchBox plugin which extracts and caches ROM archives, letting you play games faster. Also allows playing individual ROMs from merged archives, and setting preferred file type from archive (supporting PCSX2 + bin/cue files, and others).


## Description
When an archived game (in zip, 7z, or other compression format) is first extracted, it is stored in the cache. The next time the game is played, the data is loaded directly from the cache, virtually eliminating wait time.

As the cache approaches its maximum size, the least recently played games are deleted from the cache, making room for new games.


## Features
* _NEW FEATURE_ - Select and play individual ROM files from an archive!
    * Useful for GoodMerged sets.
* Skip the extraction wait time for recently played games.
* Configurable cache size and location.
* Configurable minimum archive size (skip caching small archives).
* File extension priorities per emulator and platform (cue, bin, iso, etc).

### Example Usage
Why use Archive Cache Manager? Here's some example use cases.

* Zipped ROMs located on network server or cloud drive, where disk read or network transfer time is slow.
* ROM library maintained as accurately ripped/dumped collections, where specialised compression formats not an option.
* Extract and play archives from location other than `LaunchBox\ThirdParty\7-Zip\Temp`, such as high speed SSD.
* Playing ripped PS2 games with PCSX2 where the disc image is bin/cue format, avoiding the "CDVD plugin failed to open" error message.
* Your library contains GoodMerged sets, and you want a quick way to play individual ROMs.


## Installation
* Download the latest release from https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/234-archive-cache-manager/ or https://github.com/fraganator/archive-cache-manager/releases
* Unblock the download if necessary (right-click file -> Properties -> Unblock)
* Extract this archive to your `LaunchBox\Plugins` folder, then run LaunchBox / BigBox.
* Within LaunchBox, ensure the desired emulator has the _"Extract ROM archives before running"_ option checked.


## Uninstallation
* Quit LaunchBox / BigBox, then navigate to the `LaunchBox\Plugins` folder and delete `ArchiveCacheManager`.
* Delete the archive cache folder (default is `LaunchBox\ArchiveCache`).


## Usage
Archive Cache Manager is designed to run transparent to the user. All that is required is the emulator has the _"Extract ROM archives before running"_ option checked. Extraction and cache management is carried out automatically when a game is launched.

### Selecting and Playing Individual ROMs From an Archive
To play an individual ROM from an archive containing multiple ROMs (different regions, hacks, or discs), right-click it and choose "Select ROM In Archive...".

A window will popup with a full listing of the archive contents. Select the desired ROM file, then click Play. That ROM will now launch with the configured emulator.

## Configuration
Configuration can be accessed from the _Tools->Archive Cache Manager_ menu.

An overview of each of the configuration items is below.

### Cache Path
This is the path of the cache on disk. The path can be absolute or relative, where relative paths are to the `LaunchBox` root folder.

Default: _ArchiveCache_

### Cache Size
This is the maximum cache size on disk in megabytes. The oldest played games will be deleted from the cache when it reaches this size.

Default: _20,000 MB (20 GB)_

### Minimum Archive Size
This is the minimum size in megabytes of an uncompressed archive to be added to the cache. Archives smaller than this won't be added to the cache.

Default: _100 MB_

### File Extension Priority
This defines the file extension priority for the specified emulator and platform combination. Use the Add / Edit / Delete buttons to manage file extension priorities.

File extensions are a comma delimited list, where the highest priority is the first extension, the next highest priority is the second extension, and so on. If the file extension is not found in the archive when a game is loaded, the default LaunchBox priority is used.

Note that the extension priority is applied to all archives, even if they are not cached.

Default: _PCSX2 \ Sony Playstation 2 \ bin_


## Building
The project is built with Visual Studio Community 2019 and .NET Framework 4.7.2.

An older version of the `Unbroken.LaunchBox.Plugins` assembly is preferred when building, to maintain compatibility across LaunchBox versions. The plugin is currently built against version 1.0.0.0 included with LaunchBox 10.10. It can be built with the latest version, but will not be backwards compatible.

### Dependencies
Dependencies are listed below, and can be installed using Visual Studio's Package Manager Console with the command shown.

Package               | Version | PM Command
----------------------|---------|--------------------------
System.Drawing.Common | 4.7.2   | `Install-Package System.Drawing.Common -Version 4.7.2 -ProjectName Plugin`
ini-parser            | latest  | `Install-Package ini-parser -ProjectName Core`
